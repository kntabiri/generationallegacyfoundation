<h1>Generational Legacy Foundation</h1>
<p> This foundation is built purposely to support and care for the unprivileged on the streets of Ghana and other parts of the world.
Living in Ghana, I saw a lot of people especially mothers and children sleeping under bridges, untarred areas and unconstructed buildings everyday.
It struck me to the core to create a foundation to help alleviate this situation by any means necessary. 
I truly believe that everyone on this earth has a purpose and God-given gift and talent but sometimes it is hidden due to unforeseen circumstances.
Most of these people do not arrive at their destination of calling/purpose in life. 
Sadly to say, they end up committing suicides or face an untimely death without discovering their gift and purpose.
I hope to collaborate with web design developers, software ops, and other people to help me build this website.
My team and I are willing to work tirelessly and with much effort, dedication, and commitment to change the narrative and make this vision a reality.
